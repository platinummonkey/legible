{"id":"remarkable-sync-q89","title":"Phase 2: Full .rm stroke rendering to PDF","description":"Implement full rendering of .rm binary stroke files to PDF with vector graphics.\n\nPhase 1 (remarkable-sync-6gn) implemented extraction and placeholder PDFs. This phase adds actual stroke rendering.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### 1. Parse .rm Binary Files\n- Integrate github.com/deionizedoatmeal/rmapi/encoding/rm for v6 format support\n- Read layers, lines, and point data from .rm files\n- Handle all brush types: pen, pencil, highlighter, eraser, marker\n- Extract stroke properties: color, width, pressure, coordinates\n\n### 2. Render Strokes to PDF\n- Convert reMarkable coordinates (1404x1872) to PDF coordinate system\n- Render strokes as vector graphics using pdfcpu\n- Support stroke width and pressure variations\n- Implement brush type rendering:\n  - Pen: solid lines with pressure\n  - Pencil: textured strokes\n  - Highlighter: semi-transparent overlays\n  - Marker: broad strokes\n  - Eraser: remove underlying content\n\n### 3. Layer Support\n- Render multiple layers in correct order\n- Support layer visibility/opacity\n- Preserve layer structure from reMarkable\n\n### 4. Template Rendering\n- Render page templates (Blank, Lined, Grid, Dots, etc.)\n- Template library or generation\n- Template overlay on background\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n**Option A: rmapi encoding/rm + pdfcpu**\n- Use deionizedoatmeal/rmapi/encoding/rm for parsing\n- Custom renderer with pdfcpu for vector graphics\n- Full control over output quality\n- Recommended approach\n\n**Option B: Integrate go-remarkable2pdf**\n- Use poundifdef/go-remarkable2pdf library\n- May need updates for v6 format\n- AGPL-3.0 license consideration\n- Faster implementation but less control\n\n**Option C: Hybrid**\n- Parse with encoding/rm\n- Reference go-remarkable2pdf rendering logic\n- Implement custom renderer optimized for our use case\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Test with example/Test.rmdoc (2 pages with handwriting)\n- Create test fixtures with various brush types\n- Validate stroke positioning accuracy\n- Compare output with reMarkable app PDF export\n- Performance testing with large documents\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Accurately renders all brush types\n- Correct coordinate mapping\n- Layer support working\n- Templates rendered correctly\n- Passes visual comparison tests\n- Performance: \u003c500ms per page average\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- remarkable-sync-6gn (Phase 1 converter) - COMPLETED\n- Consider creating: remarkable-sync-aef (test fixtures) for comprehensive testing\n\n## References\n\n- rmapi encoding/rm: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deionizedoatmeal/rmapi/encoding/rm\n- go-remarkable2pdf: https://github.com/poundifdef/go-remarkable2pdf\n- reMarkable format spec: https://github.com/YakBarber/remarkable_file_format\n- rmscene (v6 format): https://github.com/ricklupton/rmscene","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-30T12:05:13.059144-06:00","created_by":"cody.lee","updated_at":"2025-12-30T12:05:13.059144-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"remarkable-sync-q89","depends_on_id":"remarkable-sync-6gn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-30T12:05:18.245797-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
