# reMarkable Sync Configuration File
#
# This file demonstrates all available configuration options.
# Copy this file to ~/.remarkable-sync.yaml and customize as needed.
#
# Configuration precedence: CLI flags > Environment variables > Config file > Defaults

# Output directory for synced PDF files
# Default: ~/remarkable-sync
output-dir: ~/Documents/remarkable

# Filter documents by labels (empty list = sync all documents)
# Labels must match exactly as they appear in the reMarkable app
# Default: [] (empty, sync all)
labels:
  - work
  - important
  - personal

# Enable or disable OCR processing
# OCR adds a searchable text layer to PDFs but increases processing time
# Default: true
ocr-enabled: true

# Tesseract OCR languages (use + to combine multiple languages)
# Requires corresponding Tesseract language packs to be installed
# Common languages: eng, spa, fra, deu, ita, por, rus, ara, chi_sim, jpn
# Default: eng
ocr-languages: eng+spa

# Tesseract executable path (empty = use system PATH)
# Only needed if Tesseract is installed in a non-standard location
# Default: "" (auto-detect)
tesseract-path: ""

# Logging level: debug, info, warn, error
# debug = verbose logging for troubleshooting
# info = standard operational logging
# warn = only warnings and errors
# error = only errors
# Default: info
log-level: info

# Sync interval for daemon mode (0 = run once, not daemon)
# Examples: 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 2h
# Default: 5m
sync-interval: 10m

# State file location for tracking synced documents
# The state file enables incremental sync by tracking which documents
# have already been synced and their versions
# Default: ~/.remarkable-sync-state.json
state-file: ~/.remarkable-sync/state.json

# reMarkable authentication token (leave empty to use default location)
# Token is automatically generated during 'remarkable-sync auth'
# Default: ~/.remarkable-sync/token.json
remarkable-token: ""

# Daemon mode flag (set to true to enable daemon mode)
# When true, runs continuously with sync-interval between syncs
# When false, runs once and exits
# Default: false
daemon-mode: false

# Health check server address for daemon mode (empty = disabled)
# When set, exposes /health endpoint for monitoring
# Format: :port or host:port
# Example: :8080, localhost:8080, 0.0.0.0:8080
# Default: "" (disabled)
# health-addr: ":8080"

# PID file location for daemon mode (empty = no PID file)
# Useful for process management and ensuring single instance
# Default: "" (no PID file)
# pid-file: /var/run/remarkable-sync.pid

# ---
# Example Configurations
# ---

# Minimal configuration (sync everything with defaults):
# output-dir: ~/remarkable-sync
# ocr-enabled: true

# Work-only configuration:
# output-dir: ~/work-documents
# labels:
#   - work
#   - meetings
# ocr-enabled: true
# ocr-languages: eng

# Fast sync without OCR:
# output-dir: ~/remarkable-backup
# ocr-enabled: false
# sync-interval: 5m

# Multi-language OCR:
# output-dir: ~/documents/remarkable
# ocr-enabled: true
# ocr-languages: eng+spa+fra
# sync-interval: 15m

# Daemon with health monitoring:
# output-dir: ~/remarkable-sync
# daemon-mode: true
# sync-interval: 10m
# health-addr: ":8080"
# pid-file: ~/.remarkable-sync/daemon.pid
# log-level: info

# ---
# Environment Variables
# ---
# All config options can be overridden with environment variables
# using the REMARKABLE_SYNC_ prefix and uppercased names:
#
# export REMARKABLE_SYNC_OUTPUT_DIR=~/Documents/remarkable
# export REMARKABLE_SYNC_LABELS=work,personal
# export REMARKABLE_SYNC_OCR_ENABLED=false
# export REMARKABLE_SYNC_LOG_LEVEL=debug
# export REMARKABLE_SYNC_SYNC_INTERVAL=15m

# ---
# Notes
# ---
# - Paths with ~ are expanded to your home directory
# - Use absolute paths for reliability in daemon mode
# - Labels are case-sensitive
# - Empty labels list means sync ALL documents
# - OCR significantly increases sync time but makes documents searchable
# - First sync will be slow (processes all documents)
# - Subsequent syncs are fast (only new/changed documents)
